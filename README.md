# CICD of a Lambda function

This project demonstrates automated CI/CD for an AWS Lambda function using modern DevOps practices. It shows how to package, test, and deploy a Python Lambda function to AWS using tools that enable continuous integration and continuous delivery. The Lambda example uses `requests` and `pandas` for processing and includes a sample handler. Intended for learning and implementing serverless deployment pipelines efficiently.
